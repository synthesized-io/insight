Evaluation
==========

Synthesized includes several methods to assess the privacy, quality and utility of generated data. These can be used to answer
three related questions:

- **Privacy**: how much sensitive and private information from the original data can be extracted from the generated
  data?
- **Statistical Quality**: does the generated data closely resemble the original data, and maintain the statistical
  properties and correlations?
- **Predictive Utility**: does the generated data maintain the predictive performance for an ML
  classification/regression task?
