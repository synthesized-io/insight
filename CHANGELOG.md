# üßø Insight 0.8

In this release, the package has had an overall with a significant portion of
unused code now removed and the rest having been streamlined + improved.

‚ú® üè∑Ô∏è  The package `synthesized-insight` has now been renamed to `insight`
thanks to previous owners (@oscaracena üåü) of an old pypi project kindly
providing access.

The predominant functions in the package focus on **easy-to-use metrics** and
**intelligent plotting functions** which quickly provide insight into a pandas
`Series` (or two) or a `DataFrame` (or two).

The metrics can also be **configured from YAML** to allow for simple to
configure benchmarking and assessment scripts.
